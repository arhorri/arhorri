# 📝 How to Customize Your GitHub Profile README

This guide will help you customize your professional GitHub profile README with your personal information.

## 🎯 What to Replace

### 1. Header Section
- `[Your Name]` → Replace with your full name
- `[Your Professional Title/Role]` → Replace with your job title (e.g., "Full Stack Developer", "Data Scientist", "Software Engineer")

### 2. About Me Section
Replace the placeholder text in brackets:
- `[Current Project/Company]` → Your current project or employer
- `[Technologies/Skills you're learning]` → What you're currently learning
- `[Type of projects]` → Types of projects you want to collaborate on
- `[Your expertise areas]` → Your main skills/expertise
- `[your.email@example.com]` → Your professional email
- `[Something interesting about you]` → A fun fact about yourself

### 3. Languages and Tools Section
**Keep only the technologies you use!** The template includes common ones like:
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
- Frameworks: React, Node.js, Django
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Git

**To add more technologies:**
1. Visit [devicons.dev](https://devicons.dev/) to find icon URLs
2. Add them following this format:
```html
<a href="[technology-url]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  <img src="[icon-url]" alt="[name]" width="40" height="40"/>
</a>
```

### 4. Professional Experience Section
Replace each job entry with your actual work history:
- `[Job Title]` → Your position
- `[Company Name]` → Company name
- `[Start Date] - [End Date/Present]` → Employment period
- Add 2-4 bullet points describing key achievements
- List technologies used in each role

**Add more jobs** by copying the entire job block.

### 5. Education Section
- `[Degree Name]` → Your degree (e.g., "Bachelor of Science")
- `[Field of Study]` → Your major (e.g., "Computer Science")
- `[University Name]` → Your university
- `[Graduation Year]` → Year you graduated

**Add certifications** by listing them under the Certifications section.

### 6. Connect with Me Section
Replace the placeholders with your actual social media links:
- `[your-linkedin-username]` → Your LinkedIn username
- `[your-twitter-handle]` → Your Twitter handle
- `[your.email@example.com]` → Your email
- `[your-portfolio-website]` → Your portfolio URL

**Remove links** you don't want by deleting the entire `<a>` tag block.

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Change Color Theme
The GitHub stats use a "radical" theme. You can change it by replacing `theme=radical` with other themes:
- `theme=dark`
- `theme=default`
- `theme=tokyonight`
- `theme=dracula`
- `theme=gruvbox`

See all themes at: https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/themes/README.md

### Hide Sections You Don't Need
Simply delete entire sections (between `---` dividers) that you don't want:
- Blog Posts section (if you don't blog)
- Certifications (if you don't have any)
- Previous jobs (keep only current role)

### Add Your Own Sections
You can add custom sections like:
- 🚀 Featured Projects
- 📚 Publications
- 🎤 Speaking Engagements
- 🏅 Awards and Achievements

## 📝 Example Filled Template

Here's a quick example of how a section might look filled in:

**Before:**
```markdown

```

**After:**
```markdown
- 🔭 I'm currently working on **Building scalable web applications at TechCorp**
```
